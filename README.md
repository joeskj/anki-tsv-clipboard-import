# TSV Clipboard Import

This Anki add-on provides a menu option to import notes from a TSV
(Tab-Separated Values) file that is currently on your clipboard.

(After installing the add-on, open Anki and select
**File → Import TSV from Clipboard**) (or use the shortcut `Ctrl+Shift+V`).
The shortcut can be changed from **Tools → TSV Clipboard Import Settings**.
The text currently on your clipboard is saved to a temporary file and passed
to Anki's standard import routine.

## Releases

Each release packages the contents of the `tsv_clipboard_import` directory into a
`tsv_clipboard_import.ankiaddon` file using a GitHub Action. The packaged file
is attached to the release so you can download it from the project's Releases
page and import it directly into Anki.
