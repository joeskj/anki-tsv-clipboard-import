# TSV Clipboard Import

This Anki add-on provides a menu option to import notes from a TSV
(Tab-Separated Values) file that is currently on your clipboard.

After installing the add-on, open Anki and select **File â†’ Import TSV from Clipboard**
(or use the shortcut `Ctrl+Shift+V`). The text currently on your clipboard is
saved to a temporary file and passed to Anki's standard import routine.
