# TSV Clipboard Import

This Anki add-on provides a menu option to import notes from a TSV
(Tab-Separated Values) file that is currently on your clipboard.

(After installing the add-on, open Anki and select
**File â†’ Import TSV from Clipboard**)
(or use the shortcut `Ctrl+Shift+V`). The text currently on your clipboard is
saved to a temporary file and passed to Anki's standard import routine.

## Releases

Each release packages the contents of the `tsv_clipboard_import` directory into a
`tsv_clipboard_import.ankiaddon` file using a GitHub Action. The packaged file
is attached to the release so you can download it from the project's Releases
page and import it directly into Anki.
